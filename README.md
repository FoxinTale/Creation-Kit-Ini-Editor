# Creation Kit Ini Editor
A simple tool written in Java to allow easy appending of BSA files to the Creation Kit's INI files so it can load non base game BSA files and not have missing models and textures.
It also allows creation of the "CreationKitCustom.ini" for setting multiple master loads.

### Features
(Note: This is the planned feature list, nothing is currently included.)
- Easy GUI based INI file editing for BSA files.
- Generation of the "CreationKitCustom.ini".
- Launching of the creation kit itself from within the application.
- Support for multiple languages. (I will need assistance on translations)

### License
This is licensed under the GPL, so you are free to port this over to a better language. I wrote it in Java because it's the only language I'm competent enough in to write an application like this in.
